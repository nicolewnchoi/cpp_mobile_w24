        <p>
          With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, he seemed
          to embody both the mystery and the exuberance of life itself. Agile
          and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were his
          personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. He would curl
          up on his favorite rug, eyes half-closed in contemplation, as if
          solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene,
          Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities, teaching
          his human companions that one could be many things all at once.

        <p>
          Sprout is a 2yr old gray tabby cat. She prefers to spend her days
          sleeping on the cat tower her butler has gifted her. When she is not
          lounging around, she also likes to play attack with her favorite
          rabbit toy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She loves her butler dearly that when any stranger or even her
          butler's loved ones attempts to approach her, she would either run
          away or hiss at them out of annoyance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often
          found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when
          available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves
          people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.

        <p>
          Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the
          dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines
          when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack.
